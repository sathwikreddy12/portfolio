# AWS Static Portfolio Website (S3 + CloudFront)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to host a **static portfolio website** on **Amazon S3** and deliver it globally using **Amazon CloudFront**. The setup follows industry best practices for **static website hosting, CDN usage, and HTTPS enablement**, making it suitable for learning and real-world DevOps fundamentals.

The website is built using **HTML and CSS**, version-controlled with **Git**, and deployed using **AWS services**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a personal static portfolio website
* Host the website using Amazon S3 static website hosting
* Configure public access securely using bucket policies
* Use Amazon CloudFront as a CDN for faster and secure delivery
* Enable HTTPS using CloudFront default TLS certificate
* Understand real-world cloud deployment workflow

---

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1️⃣ Website Development

* Created a responsive static portfolio using HTML and CSS
* Verified locally by opening `index.html` in a browser

### 2️⃣ Version Control with Git

* Initialized a Git repository
* Committed source code
* Pushed code to GitHub

### 3️⃣ Amazon S3 Setup

* Created an S3 bucket with a globally unique name
* Enabled **Static Website Hosting**
* Set `index.html` as the default root object
* Uploaded website files

### 4️⃣ Bucket Policy Configuration

* Disabled **Block Public Access**
* Added bucket policy to allow public read (`s3:GetObject`)

### 5️⃣ Website Verification

* Verified website using S3 website endpoint:

  ```
  http://<bucket-name>.s3-website.<region>.amazonaws.com
  ```

### 6️⃣ Amazon CloudFront Configuration

* Created a CloudFront distribution
* Set S3 website endpoint as origin
* Enabled HTTP → HTTPS redirection
* Used default CloudFront TLS certificate
* Disabled AWS WAF to avoid unnecessary costs

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* HTTPS enabled via CloudFront TLS certificate
* No backend or sensitive data exposed
* Minimal permissions granted using bucket policies
* AWS WAF intentionally not enabled for cost efficiency

---

## 💰 Cost Considerations

* Amazon S3: Free Tier eligible
* Amazon CloudFront: Pay-as-you-go (minimal usage)
* AWS WAF: Not enabled to avoid extra charges

---

## 📦 Deliverables

* ✅ Static portfolio website (HTML + CSS)
* ✅ GitHub repository with version history
* ✅ Publicly accessible S3-hosted website
* ✅ CloudFront distribution with HTTPS
* ✅ README documentation explaining architecture and steps

---

## 📸 Screenshots (Optional)

*Add screenshots of:*

* S3 bucket configuration
* CloudFront distribution status
* Live website output

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Difference between S3 API endpoint and S3 website endpoint
* Importance of CDN for performance and security
* Real-world AWS account verification process
* Cost-aware cloud architecture design

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Custom domain using Route 53
* HTTPS with ACM custom certificate
* CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
* Cache invalidation automation
